# Practical Statistics for Data Scientists
## Introduction
Statistics is the branch of science that deals with the collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting the data. The field of statistics basically divided into two parts such as; 
1. Descriptive Statistics: It deals with the collecting, analyzing, and summarizing the data. 
2. Inferential Statistics: It is a technique which makes the conclusions about the whole data (population) by observing small amount of data (sample).

Below, I tried to summarize first few Chapters of this book with Jupyter notebook files using various datasets obtained from Kaggle and other sources.
## Chapter 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
This chapter focuses on the first step in any data science project: exploring the data. Exploratory data analysis, or EDA, is a comparatively new area of statistics. In 1962, John W. Tukey called for a reformation of statistics in his seminal paper “The Future of Data Analysis” [Tukey-1962]. With the ready availablility of computing power and expressive data analysis software, exploratory data analysis has evolved well beyond its original scope. Key drivers of this discipline have been the rapid development of new technology, access to more and bigger data, and the greater use of quantitative analysis in a variety of disciplines.
